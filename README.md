# .dotfiles

Having a cluttered, and unorganized `$HOME` always bothered me, so I made this repo in order to organize it. I used symlinks in order to keep my files in a separate directory and link them to my `$HOME` so that I keep the same functionality.

Less important files like `.zsh_history` don't even need to be in your home directory, so you can just keep them in a .dotfiles folder without linking them.

## Note
- Some configurations might be exclusive to MacOS, such as the macos plugin from oh-my-zsh or the iOS simulator.
